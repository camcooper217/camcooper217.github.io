        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently working as an e-commerce specialist within the skincare industry.
        <br> About 1.5 months ago I took on learning web development for a couple reasons: 
        <br> 1. I felt it was going to help my current position. 
        <br> 2. I wanted to acquire a skill that I can apply to side projects.</p>
