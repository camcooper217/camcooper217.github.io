<h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I am currently working as a e-commerce specialist within the skincare industry.
    <br> About 1.5 months ago I took on learning web development for a couple reasons. 
    <br> 1. I felt it was going to help my current postion. 
    <br> 2. I wanted to acquire a skill that I can apply to side projects. </p>
